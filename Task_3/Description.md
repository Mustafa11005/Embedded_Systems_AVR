AVR LED Snake-like Pattern Display

A simple AVR-based project that demonstrates a LED pattern display.

Features:

- Displays a pattern of LEDs connected to PORTA
- Uses a loop to sequence through the LEDs
- Includes delay functions for LED animation

Functionality:

- Initializes all LEDs connected to PORTA
- Turns off all LEDs initially
- Uses a loop to sequence through the LEDs, turning them on and off in a specific pattern
- Includes delay functions to control the animation speed

Technical Details:

- Written in C programming language for AVR microcontrollers
- Uses the AVR-GCC compiler
- Follows standard AVR coding conventions and best practices

Hardware Requirements:

- AVR microcontroller (e.g. ATmega32)
- 8 LEDs
- Breadboard and jumper wires

Usage:

1- Connect the hardware components as described above.
2- Compile the program using AVR-GCC.
3- Upload the program to the AVR microcontroller using a programmer 
(e.g. AVRISP).
4- Observe the LED pattern display.
